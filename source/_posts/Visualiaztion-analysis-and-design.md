## Chapter 1 What's Vis and Why Do It?

这一章主要是回答以下问题来框定本书的讨论范围。

### 1. Why have a human in the decision-making loop?

For well-defined questions, people can use purely computational techniques(e.g. machine learning and statistics). However, for ill-specified problems, people do not know which questions are the right one in advance. In such cases, the best path forward is an analysis process with a human in the loop, where you can exploit the powerful pattern detection properties of the human visual system.

### 2. Why have a computer in the loop?

Because the datasets are too large that they would be completely infeasible to draw by hand.

### 3. Why use an external representation?

Because it augments human capacity by allowing us to surpass the limitations of our own internal coginition and memory.
