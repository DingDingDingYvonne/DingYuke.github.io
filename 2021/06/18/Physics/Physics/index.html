        <p><strong>introduction</strong><br>While art and physics are often seen as two separate and opposing ends of human intellectual activity, “Art and Physics” suggests the possibility of linking the two fields: both were inspired by the same “cosmic spirit” at the source of their creation, making artworks of the same period an incredible match for physical works. The paper begins with a chronological overview of the history of physics and the history of art, followed by an interpretation of the “cosmic spirit” proposed by author Klein. Schlein argues that art and physics stood at the forefront of the same era and faced the same world, allowing artists and physicists to share the same powers of observation and intuition at the beginning of their work. Through an examination of physics and art creation, this paper argues that the intuitive experience of the two is fundamentally different and proposes a higher dimension of true cosmic spirit: art and physics are linked by the language they both create in their exploration of the chaotic world, the freedom to break the limits and peer into the larger world, and the adventure of infinity forever.</p>
<h3 id="1-The-Interweaving-of-Physics-and-Art-History"><a href="#1-The-Interweaving-of-Physics-and-Art-History" class="headerlink" title="1. The Interweaving of Physics and Art History"></a>1. The Interweaving of Physics and Art History</h3><p>Art and Physics attempts to weave together the history of art and the history of physics, imaginatively linking seemingly unrelated artistic visions to physical concepts. For author Schlein, there is a connection between the baffling nature of modern art and the profound subtleties of modern physics. He draws a broad chronological thread through the history of the development of art and physics, supported by narratives surrounding specific genres, and concludes with the author’s overall reflection on the relationship between art and physics. This section outlines the general history of physics and art, and provides support for the subsequent discussion of the spirit of the universe.</p>
<h4 id="Before-the-Modern-European-Time-and-Perspective"><a href="#Before-the-Modern-European-Time-and-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="Before the Modern: European Time and Perspective"></a>Before the Modern: European Time and Perspective</h4><p>Western civilization begins with ancient Greece. The ancient Greeks were rational and logical, and lived in a simple Euclidean space. Euclidean space was linear, homogeneous, and continuous, constructed by a linear strong logic like a triad. This space is also holistic, calm, and unaffected. It is like an empty shell or container into which the Greeks can put all kinds of real substances, which have distinct boundaries with space and do not create connections. This spatial composition conforms to the intuitive human perception. The mathematical concept of geometry profoundly influenced the perception of space-time in a period of time, and was also reflected in the canvas of painters. Perspective was born on the basis of European space, and for a time became very fashionable, regulating the creative paradigm of a generation of artists. A painting that conforms to the principle of perspective is a reasonable enough work, representing the point of no shadow at infinity and the logical relationship between the painted objects is very important.</p>
<p>In contrast to the intuitive nature of linear infinite space, time does not readily exhibit a similar nature. The seasons alternate, rivers rise and fall, but people are not allowed to die and come back to life, and the cyclical and acyclical nature of time creates a conflict. Aristotle used Greek mythology to regulate the concept of time: past, present and future, arbitrarily linearizing time to fit into the already standardized and ordered system of space. Aristotle himself, on the other hand, believed in the cyclical nature of time, which demonstrates the uncertainty and indecision about the nature of time at the time. The topic of time was always set aside and left unattended.</p>
<p>In this period the Western body of knowledge was not yet sufficiently complex and divided, and physics and art did not yet stand on their own, pointing equally to man’s perception of the world as a whole. It was not until the Middle Ages that theology suppressed science and placed reason and sensibility in opposition, causing the reverence for reason to have an inelastic soar after the Middle Ages, coming to the Renaissance. The awakening of man emphasized the perspective of observing the world with human subjects, and the dichotomy of subject and object gave birth to the prototype of modern science. The classical physical world was gradually constructed and completed, and the development of science brought abundant results. At that time, people generally believed that the kernel of the world had been determined, and all phenomena could be described by this system as long as the technical problems of classical physics extrapolation were solved. The sublime status of reason was gradually separated from sensibility and absolutized, and this concept of “the supremacy of reason” was also reflected in art: painters despised bright colors that affected emotions and respected lines that maintained form and order, and the color palette of artworks of the period was dark and elegant, not easy to appear inflammatory and strong colors.<br>Translated with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.deepl.com/Translator">www.DeepL.com/Translator</a><br>…</p>
